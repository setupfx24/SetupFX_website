/**
 * SwissCresta marketing home — full broker landing port from the
 * legacy Swistrade Next 14 site. Keep the file as a thin composer —
 * each section lives in `@/landing/marketing/*` and is independently
 * editable.
 *
 * The parent `(landing)/layout.tsx` already mounts the shared Navbar +
 * LandingFooter for light marketing routes. We deliberately do NOT
 * mount `marketing/Navbar.tsx` here — that component is ported for
 * future use (multi-tier sub-nav with PRIVATE/PARTNERS/INSTITUTIONAL/
 * CAREERS/GROUP hover dropdowns) but mounting it here would double up
 * the chrome.
