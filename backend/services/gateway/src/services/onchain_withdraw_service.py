"""Decentralized USDT withdrawal flow.

Mirrors `onchain_deposit_service.py` for the payout direction:

  Trader picks chain (eth/bsc/tron) + USD amount → server snapshots the
  linked wallet address as the destination, debits main_wallet_balance
  immediately (frozen for review), inserts a `withdrawals` row with
  status='pending'. Admin reviews on the back office, signs the on-chain
  transfer from the admin deposit wallet, pastes the resulting tx hash;
  `chain_verifier_engine` confirms the transfer landed and flips the row
  to 'paid'. Reject-path refunds the debit.

Destination address is ALWAYS user.wallet_address. The
`destination_address` parameter is ignored — kept on the wire purely for
the trader UI to show what it thinks the linked wallet is.
